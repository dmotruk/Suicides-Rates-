# Suicides-Rates-
A simple analysis to better understand suicide rates around the world

To better improve my data analysis skills I have started this project. When I have time I will add new findings based on new techniques 
that I learn from my own research and from my class work.

I hope to document my growth within the field and hopefully extract meaningful insights.
